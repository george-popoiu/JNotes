JNotes
======

A portable and lightweight app for keeping notes similar to StickyNotes
in Windows 7.

Important !!
============

The first connection to the database takes around 20 seconds. Subsequent connections take around 2 seconds.
JNotes.zip contains the executable .jar file as well as the Apache Derby
Embedded database files. 
 You must keep JNotes.jar in the same folder as myDB, otherwise the app
will create another database which takes about 20 seconds.
